Thought 1
Regardless of how you feel about Mr. Snowden, his point is spot-on.  As kids we read books like George Orwell's 1984 and fretted over the day when our government would become so powerful that they would be watching our every move.  And that has sort of happened, except it's not the government who is doing the watching but our corporate state. And it's not like it happened while we put up a fight about it.  No, instead we've welcomed it into our lives with open arms.  We've trusted companies like Facebook and Google to keep our private lives safe even while we were feeding more and more of our personal information to them in the name of convenience.  

Thought 2
When you really think about it, the internet is one of the most amazing things the human race has ever created.  It allows people from anywhere on the globe to connect to each other instantly and it gives everyone the power to broadcast their voice to the world.
