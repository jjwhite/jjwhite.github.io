Main Points:
- The internet is fundamentally broken
- What used to be individual sites is now walled gardens 
- RSS was designed to solve the problem of needing to remember URLs
	- It would be your feed of curated sites
- We need to bring back the golden age of blogging but with your own domain!
- There are excellent tools and features of social media that need solutions
	- Groups, events, messaging, etc.
- We need to go backwards which is funny as I'm usually a person who scoffs at not moving forward
- can we build a "find friends" rss feed finder?

Thought 1
Regardless of how you feel about Mr. Snowden, his point is spot-on.  As kids we read books like George Orwell's 1984 and fretted over the day when our government would become so powerful that they would be watching our every move.  And that has sort of happened, except it's not the government who is doing the watching but our corporate state. And it's not like it happened while we put up a fight about it.  No, instead we've welcomed it into our lives with open arms.  We've trusted companies like Facebook and Google to keep our private lives safe even while we were feeding more and more of our personal information to them in the name of convenience.  

Thought 2
When you really think about it, the internet is one of the most amazing things the human race has ever created.  It allows people from anywhere on the globe to connect to each other instantly and it gives everyone the power to broadcast their voice to the world.

Thought 3
As a web developer I have spent the last 15 years making my living on the internet.  It is, in my opinion, the greatest invention of human-kind so far and its power to connect and unite people is the future of our civilitaztion.  That being said, however, the internet is broken.  Like really broken.

Thought 4

Let's bring back RSS.  Remember RSS?  You know, Really Simple Syndication.  It was a simple technology that allowed us to follow what our friends were posting on the internet before we all got sucked into "Social Media".  I have a website, I post stuff there and anyone can subscribe to it using any reader they choose.
