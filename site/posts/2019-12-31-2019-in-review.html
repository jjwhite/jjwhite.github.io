        <p>2019-12-31</p>
        <h1>My Biggest Accomplishments</h1>
<h2>Running a Half Marathon and Getting Myself into Better Shape</h2>
<p>I may arguably be in the best shape of my life right now thanks to deciding late in 2018 that I wanted to run a half-marathon in 2019.  It was a goal that, at the time, seemed almost impossible and I’m really proud to say that I was able to push through and make it happen.  I learned a lot about myself as I struggled through physical setbacks, early mornings, and freezing temperatures on my way from the couch to 13.1 miles in 2 hours flat.  I’ve managed to keep running (albeit not nearly as far) for the remainder of the year and even won 1st place in my age group in a 5k this fall.  I also lost 40 lbs during the process and have managed to keep almost all of it off.  I learned 2 big lessons on this journey: running and exercise are really important to me, and I should always trust the process.  Sticking to a plan was the only way I was ever going to achieve my goal and many days when I wanted nothing to do with running I did it anyway because that’s what the plan called for.</p>
<h2>Making Reading a Priority</h2>
<p>I did not set out to read X number of books or anything like that this year but I did make the conscious decision to focus more on books and less on other forms of media (including internet articles).  In the end I read about 26 books this year which is a big jump from my usual number.  I also chose to read more non-fiction and literature with a focus on stoic philosophy and mindfulness.  See all the books I read this year <a href="/books">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Being More Honest with Myself</h2>
<p>2019 was a year that I tried to put my finger on why I was feeling so “blah” for so long.  Feeling like each day was blending into the next, like I was living every day just to make it through to the next.  I was feeling like I was living someone else’s life, or at the very least, not living true to myself. This introspection led me to the realization that maybe I didn’t really know who I even was.  Had I made all my decisions leading up until now based on what I really wanted or was it all because it’s what I thought I was “supposed” to be doing?  I realized that I hadn’t really been living intentionally.  I hadn’t always listened to or trusted my own heart and that “blah” feeling was the result. I was living my life as a series of reactions to the events and people around me and was constantly just searching for protection from discomfort. Coming to this realization was very freeing in many ways.  I realized that there were things that were within my control that I could work on in order to start moving in a direction that I could be happy and fulfilled. Although I wouldn’t say that my life has gotten easier as a result of this new outlook, I can say for sure that I have more frequently felt at peace, in control, sure of myself, and more present than I have in a very long time. </p>
<h1>2020 and Beyond</h1>
<p>My biggest goal for 2020 is to live much more intentionally as a whole.  I want to find a balance where I can feel in control of the things that are within my power to control while letting go of those things outside of my control.  I want to seek wholeness and fulfillment in my personal life, work life, and relationships.  In order to achieve this I’ve been thinking a lot about routine and processes that I can build into my life that, when followed with discipline, would lead to more intentionality and happiness.  The goal of these processes is multi-tiered:
- Limit non-essential decisions (a daily exercise routine, eating the same things for breakfast and lunch, etc.)
- Cultivate focus (When I sit down to do any type of work, I want to get more done in less time)
- Allow more time for leisure (creating focus should allow me to get more done which will lead to more time for relationships, hobbies, etc.)
- Cultivate retrospection and growth and allow for evolution as things in my life change.
- Get things out of my head so that I can slow down and be more present at all times.
- Find balance between mind, body, and spirit.
- Asking “Why?” more frequently</p>
