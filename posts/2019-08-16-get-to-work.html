        <p>You screwed up?  Someone screwed you?  Now you find yourself in a situation you couldn't have imagined just moments ago?  Are you angry?  Feeling bad for yourself? Beating yourself up or blaming someone else for your problems.  </p>
<p>You know what? Maybe it's not your fault. That happens sometimes.  But here's the thing.  You're still responsible.  Response Able. Fault has nothing to do with it now.  It's on your plate.  You are able to respond.</p>
<p>More likely you played some role in getting to this position.  Own up to it.  Look in the mirror and say: "I did/didn't do X and now I'm in this position" Accept it.  Learn from it.  You now have a choice.  Let this break you or let it propel you.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3L1B8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The obstacle is the way</a>.  </p>
<p>What other choice to you have?  To wallow in self-pity?  To scream and yell and blame everyone else?  Where does this get you?  Are you any closer to solving your problem?  Stop all that nonsense.  Let it go.  </p>
<p>Do you need a moment?  Take it.  That's fine.  Let the tears fall.  Hug a friend.  Go for a run or to the gym.  Get your aggression out.  Yell, curse.  Do what you need to do.  Are you finished? Did you get it out of your system? Good.</p>
<p>Take
A
Breath.</p>
<p>Another One.</p>
<p>Now, are you ready to begin?  Look at the problem. Walk around it.  Inspect every detail.  Not how you got here, not at who is at fault but the actual PROBLEM.  Do you see it?  In all its hideous glory...sitting there.  Mocking you.  Trying to take you down.  Look at it right in the eyes and say: "You won't take me down.  I will take YOU down"</p>
<p>What can you do right now to start working towards the solution?  Do it.  Right fucking now.  Make the plan and GET. TO. WORK.</p>
