<img src="/images/JonWhiteSB.jpg" style="float:left; margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;"/> Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  As you probably deduced from the URL my name is Jon White.  I'm a developer by trade, specializing in web and mobile applications at <a href="https://mathway.com" target="_blank">Mathway</a>.  In addition, I do some moonlighting as co-owner of <a href="https://solarsail.io" target="_blank">Solar Sail Tech</a>. 

In my spare time  you might find me taking some <a href="https://500px.com/jjwhite01" target="_blank">photographs</a>, going out for <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/32848045" target="_blank">a run</a>, writing some <a href="https://github.com/jjwhite" target="_blank">code for fun</a>, or <a href="/books">reading a good book</a>.  If you can't find me doing any of those things I'm probably out spending time with my beautiful wife and 3 kids. 

I'm always looking for ways to improve and squeeze more out of life. This site is a place where I post about what I'm doing, what I've learned, or anything else that comes to mind.
